== Description ==

Loading fonts from Google is a privacy protection issue.
Everytime you connect to google your visitors data will
be transmitted.

So why not use the explicitly free font on own host to
protected visitors privacy.

This Plugin communicates directly with the google font api
to fetch the webfonts and style rules.

== Sumedia Google Fonts ==

In the backend you can reload the font list
to get the actually included fonts to the database.

Currently no huge database will be present in Version 0.1.0
there is just the font Lato and Source Sans Pro Family included -
more will come and it's a way of manually adding to support more fonts.

If you have reloaded the font database, you can decide via bulk action
to use a font. So it will be loaded into the Frontend.

To finaly use the font you have to give a class with the fonts name
to the used block.

There are options during editing on the right site via "Block" tab under
"Extended". There you say "lato-light" as a class, for example.
